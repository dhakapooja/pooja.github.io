		<h1>Supermart - Flipkart Grocery</h1>
		<p>Recko enables AI-powered reconciliation of digital transactions & keeps track of the complete transaction
			lifecycle for organizations. Around Q2 of 2020, the company had few early B2B customers (Myntra, Lenskart,
			Dunzo, Licious), and the product was growing in complexity. It was a good time for someone to come in and
			standardise a few things to bring consistency across the product.</p>
		<p>Parikshit (Recko Design lead) approached me in June about building a design system at Recko. They needed
			someone to take ownership and lead the design process.</p>
		<p>This sounded perfect for me, as I was playing around design systems for a couple of years then. But in
			previous projects, building a design system was always a side thing that I did while working on other
			product features. This time, it was my primary focus.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
		<br>

				<font style="color: #3D3D3D; font-weight: 300;"> Making efforts to invoke a sense of trust about the DS

			</li>

		</ol>

		<br><br>
		<h2 id="preparation">1. Preparation</h2>
		<p>First 2–3 weeks, it was all about conversations. When I started, Recko was a small company with less than 50
			people. I didn't know many of the team members; wasn't aware of the team culture, product vision and other
			development practices that the team followed.</p>
		<p>I made it my primary task to understand these aspects of Recko before moving on to the next step. Discussions
			with Saurya (CEO) and Prashant (CTO) gave me a sense of their vision for the company. On top of this, inputs
			from the product, marketing and sales teams helped me get alignment on Recko's personality in the outside
			world.</p>
		<p>We then went on to define the <strong>Recko Design Principles.</strong> The principles aimed to enable
			conversations, guide the thought process and help reach solutions to product problems. These principles
			became the core of how we built experiences at Recko.</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/ReckoDesignPrinciples.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Recko Design Principles</p>
		<p>We will detail out the principles in a separate post.</p>
		<p class="quote">In some cases, teams start the design system without design principles, which may work too. But
			it really helps to have principles as a north star while building the design system.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>UI audit</h3>
		<p>In parallel with the principles, I started the process to audit the then existing product interface.</p>
		<p>This exercise allows getting a bird's eye view of the product on a component level and can be used later to
			prioritise component creation. This also serves as an archive during the later stages of the DS building
			process.</p>
	</div>


	<img class="img-compact" style="cursor: none;" src="images/recko/UIAudit.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">UI audit (blurred)</p>
		<br>
		<p>Here are the items documented in the audit:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Compilation of every single UI element and its variations.</li>
			<li>Page layout grids used in the product. e.g. pages using full width, pages with centre-aligned content,
				pages with sidebars, modals etc.</li>
			<li>Typefaces used and their purpose.</li>
			<li>Iconography</li>
			<li>Colour palette (different hex codes) used across the product.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Finalising the stack</h3>
		<p>The team decided to use Figma for Recko Design system. Managing styles and components is a breeze on Figma,
			and we had no second thoughts about going ahead with the tool.</p>
		<p>For documentation, I had gotten used to and hence preferred Notion, so did most of the other members in the
			design team. But rest of the org was on Google docs. So we went ahead with Google docs.</p>
		<p class="quote">As it turns out later in the building process, we learned that the dev team was more
			comfortable in Figma handoffs; and we eventually started documenting everything (components, behaviour, edge
			cases etc.) in Figma itself.</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/Documentation.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">First few weeks of documentation in Google docs</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2 id="foundation">2. DS Foundation</h2>
		<p>Till this point, all I did was wrap my head around what Recko did and set some basic guidelines for the
			things to come. In the next few weeks, we defined the foundational items of the Recko Design system.</p>
		<p>I go by the following order while defining the foundational items of a design system:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Spacing scale</li>
			<li>Layout and column grid</li>
			<li>Type scale</li>
			<li>Color</li>
			<li>Icon library</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-center" src="images/recko/DSChronology.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p>The above order ensures that we don't have structural debt while defining a particular item. e.g. If there is
			no concrete definition of spacing scale, it becomes tricky to define the layout grid.</p>
		<p>Even though the above order is ideal, but in the real world, there will always be tight deadlines to follow
			and seldom will you get the luxury of time to define each item exhaustively.</p>
		<p class="quote">So it is usually a good practice to define the bare minimums for each step so that it doesn't
			block the next one and try to refine later; allowing you to keep things moving.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>1. Spacing scale</h3>
		<p>We (design and front end team) decided to use 4px as a base unit for all our measurements in layouts and UI
			elements across the platform.</p>
		<p>This means a 4px incremental scale for:
			<br>
			- margins and paddings in the UI elements
			<br>
			- sizes for all components</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/SpacingScale.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p>We made sure to involve the front end team while finalising the base unit. The cherry on top would be if the
			front end team creates classes based on frequently used spaces (e.g. classes tiny, small, medium for 4px,
			8px and 12px respectively and so on).</p>
		<p>This also ensures that the dev team talks in classes instead of pixels, bringing quicker adoption and fewer
			chances of errors.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>2. Layout and column Grid</h3>
		<p>Recko DS was being developed for desktop first. To streamline the process, I usually follow these steps to
			narrow down on the layout and column grid for a particular page in the app.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Identify different page elements and layouts</li>
			<li>Choose an n column grid</li>
			<li>Define column grid margins and gutter</li>
			<li>For each page, identify the page elements and define the best possible grid behaviour</li>
		</ol>

		<br>
		<p><strong>2.1. Identify different page elements and layouts</strong><br>
			Using UI audit document, we identified and categorised different page elements and layouts used in the app.
			Here are a few examples of page elements and page layouts.</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/Layout.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Examples of different page elements and layouts</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>2.2. Choose an n column grid</strong><br>We decided to use the 12 column grid for the content-area
			(canvas) of the app.</p>
		<p>Reason being 12 columns grid is easily divisible by 3, 4 and 6; conveniently dividing the content-area into
			4, 3 or 2 columns respectively. Also, the design and dev team were well versed with the 12 column grid. So
			that helped too.</p>
		<p>In this scenario, the sidebar (if any) remains fixed width, and the remaining area can be taken up by the
			content-area (12 column grid).</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/TwelvecolumnGrid.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">12 column grid for content-area</p>
		<p>Other option can be having a percentage based layout - wherein the entire page is divided in percentages.
			e.g. 20–80 percentage scale for sidebar and content-area.</p>
		<p>I prefer the former option, as it gives more control handling the content-area items; but I have seen teams
			successfully use percentage-based grids in the past.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>2.3. Define column grid margins and gutter</strong><br>Grid margin is the spaces on the left and
			right edge of the content-area grid. Gutter space is the space between 2 adjacent columns in the column
			grid.</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/MarginAndGutter.png">

	<br>
	<div class="div-container">
		<p>Ideally, we try to keep the values for both grid margin and gutter constant across the app. e.g. In case of
			content-area with sidebar, even though the available area shrinks in width, the reduction in width should
			reflect in individual column width, not in grid margin or gutter space.</p>
		<p>Also, grid margin is applicable only when the entire available width is used to display content. If the
			content is centre aligned with some max-width, the margin is set automatically.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>2.4 For each page, identify the page elements and define the best possible grid
				behaviour</strong><br>Once global attributes were set, we started to scan each page to identify the
			repeating page elements and define the content-area grid behaviour.</p>
		<p>E.g. content-area in some pages will be centre-aligned (in forms for more focus) vs in some pages
			content-area will be spread in the entire available space (in dashboards for more visibility).</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/GridBehaviour.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Grid behaviour based on context</p>
		<p>This step is context driven, and the grid behaviour for each page may vary based on product context.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>3. Type scale</h3>
		<p>In this step of DS foundation, we covered the following items:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Choosing typefaces to be used across the app</li>
			<li>Defining a type-scale for each typeface</li>
		</ol>

		<p>One thing to note before moving to typeface shopping - we had decided to follow a line-height based grid (vs
			baseline grid). Reason being it is easier to manage in Figma and has a better CSS support than baseline.</p>
		<p><a target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2GtQIvH">Read more here</a> ↗</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/LineheightVBaseline.png">


	<div class="div-container">
		<p>For a given typeface, each font-size is tightly coupled with its line-height. But we chose to have variations
			in font-weight for each size to improve flexibility.</p>
		<p class="quote">In my experience, teams are less aware of this coupling of font-size and line-height. Since all
			UI specs revolve around the line-height, it becomes vital to ensure that they understand this relationship
			and practice it.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>3.1 Choosing typefaces</strong><br>To begin, the UI audit document became a good reference to narrow
			down on the typefaces and their respective font-sizes. Graphik was used as a primary typeface across the
			app.</p>
		<p>As it turned out, line-height was not thought out while implementing the typeface in the designs, and this
			was causing an issue. Graphik is a beautiful typeface, but while implementing it in UI elements, it did not
			align well vertically. It felt a little <i>bottom-shifted.</i></p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/Graphik.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p>This seemed like a small issue until we tested it with Figma auto-layout for creating the component library.
			In July 2020, Figma did not support variable padding vertically, and the components looked something like
			this:</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/GraphikAutoLayout.png">


	<div class="div-container">
		<p>At the time of writing this, Figma still did not support variable padding vertically. We tried a couple of
			workarounds, but it felt like a compromise. Hence we decided to update the typeface - something close to
			what we had, but one which could solve the issue.</p>
		<p>Choosing a new typeface involves many considerations and simultaneously trying to answer the following
			questions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Does the typeface appropriately reflect the brand's identity?</li>
			<li>Will a single typeface suffice for both product and marketing content?</li>
			<li>How will a typeface affect product performance?</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<p>Answer to these questions varies depending on the type of the company and the target scope of the design
			system.</p>
		<p>On experimenting with various options, we decided to use Inter as a primary typeface across the app. It is
			close to the earlier typeface, thus not giving a visual jerk reaction to the end-user. It has enough weight
			variations to choose from and loading times are quick too; and most importantly, it solved the vertical
			alignment issue.</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/GraphikvInter.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p><strong>3.2 Defining a type-scale</strong><br>Reducing the number of font-sizes to be used across the system
			improves consistency, but can be limiting as well. This was our purpose of defining a type-scale: to define
			a set of font-sizes and respective weights to be used in the design system.</p>
		<p class="quote">The aim was to keep a balance between limiting the number of sizes, but also gifting
			flexibility to designers by allowing variations in weights.</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/TypeScale.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p>As mentioned earlier, each font-size is tightly coupled with line-height; and the line-height follows a 4px
			scale we defined in the first step.</p>
		<p>For defining variations in font-weights, I usually follow a simple rule. The farther away the font-size is
			from the base size, lower the number of variations in font-weight.</p>
		<p>e.g. Base size has the most number of variations for flexibility, and bigger font-sizes (usually headings)
			will have not more than one font-weight for consistency.</p>
		<p>Note: We did not define the styles, but only the scale. Designers were given the freedom to play around with
			text content based on context while creating a particular component.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>4. Colors</h3>
		<p>Building a color palette for a design system is a lengthy exercise, involving collaboration from multiple
			departments - graphic design, marketing, development and business teams. Also, it entails considering
			numerous aspects like target devices, target audience, accessibility and so on.</p>
		<p>But with stiff timelines, this step can become a bottleneck for creating the component library. So to avoid
			slowing down the entire process, we followed the bare-minimum rule.</p>
		<p>We figured bare minimum would include finalising hex codes (or HSL) for the following items:</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/Color.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p>These colors allowed us to get started on the component library. Primary color took care of all the enabled
			or active states of the components. It was essential to freeze on a background colour as it can easily
			change the mood of the entire page.</p>
		<p>Defining the Gray scale meant we had fixed hexes for stroke, secondary text color and disabled states for the
			component library.</p>
		<p>We had the necessary foundation laid for the color palette, allowing us to move to the next step. Rest
			palette was built in parallel as we made progress.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>5. Icon set</h3>
		<p>Unlike other UI elements, icons have a unique way of conveying information to the user and are fundamental to
			the design system. Icons are not as attention-seeking as illustrations but are capable of providing helpful
			context in places of uncertainty.</p>
		<p>Each brand should have its own icon-set, but it is also time-consuming to create one. This process of
			creating an icon-set, like color palette, can run in parallel while building the component library.</p>
		<p>But certain things about the icons can be finalised before-hand:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Recommended dimensions (should follow spacing scale)</li>
			<li>Filled vs outline icons and their usage</li>
			<li>Rounded vs sharp edges and their usage</li>
		</ul>

	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/Icons.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p>Once we got this finalised, we searched for an open-source icon library that matched our requirements and
			used it till our icon-set was ready.</p>
		<p>This was the last step in DS Foundation. We had laid enough groundwork to be able to start creating the
			component library.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="components">3. DS Components</h2>
		<p>Components, UI library or UI kit in the design system is a collection of reusable UI elements in the app
			interface. The process of creating and documenting a set of components is well documented across the
			internet and hence won't go into too much detail here.</p>
		<p><a href="https://bit.ly/3jIf6rw" target="blank">Tutorial on YouTube</a> ↗</p>
		<p>UI audit document helped us to narrow down and prioritise the order of individual component creation. The
			guidelines set in the DS foundation enabled us to maintain consistency on a very granular level for each
			component.</p>
		<p>The whole effort to create, test and document the v1 of the entire library took us around 8–10 weeks.</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-compact" src="images/recko/Banners.png">


	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">e.g. Banner message component</p>
		<br>
		<p>The front end team picked up the component development in parallel from the first week. Once the foundational
			items were set in code, things started to pick up speed.</p>
		<p class="quote">The upcoming product feature is entirely built on the new guidelines and UI library by the
			front end team, and so far, the foundation feels pretty stable.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="adoption">4. Adoption</h2>
		<p>To make the efforts worth, adoption of the design system guidelines and components by the design and dev team
			is critical. I feel the way to ensure adoption is to invoke a sense of trust about the DS in both the design
			and dev team.</p>
		<p>The DS should give the designer enough flexibility so that they prefer not to detach that component or break
			that particular spacing guideline. At the same time, in cases where the DS falls short, the designer takes
			the onus to communicate and overcome the shortcoming in the next DS version.</p>
		<p>All good developers take pride in writing clean code. There is always a hint of hesitation to override a
			class to handle edge cases or to accommodate deviations in design files; as it can come back to haunt them
			later.</p>
		<p>Suppose the DS guidelines are appropriately set, with consideration of all use cases, and the design team is
			following the DS in their handoffs. In that case, there is no reason for the failure of adoption in the dev
			team.</p>
		<p>To ensure this, I tend to practice the following things while building a DS:</p>
	</div>

	<img data-enlargeable class="img-center" src="images/recko/Adoption.png">


	<div class="div-container">
		<p><strong>Communicate regularly</strong><br>In the initial days, we used to have daily sync ups to discuss
			progress on the design system. Even if we documented something, we ensured verbal communication across the
			team. Once the necessary groundwork was laid, the sync ups were toned down to alternate days or twice a
			week.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Keep it inclusive</strong><br>Communicating regularly made sure we included members of both the
			design and dev team in the discussions. Each brought with them particular expertise or product context.
			Also, people hate when you expect them to follow guidelines without being consulted.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Provide quick support</strong><br>Having a dedicated person to provide quick support in cases of
			confusion or shortcomings was vital. Also, a dedicated slack channel became a common discussion place for
			everything DS.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>DS QA before the handoff</strong><br>A quick design system QA before any design handoff helped to
			identify and fill the gaps between DS and design implementation (if any).</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Keep a changelog</strong><br>A changelog is a timeline view of updates happening to the design
			system. It helped improve visibility, monitor progress and gave a sense of momentum to the whole DS building
			process.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p style="text-align: center;">• • • •</p>
		<br>
		<p>With the critical foundation laid and tested, in coming months, the team plans to work on other aspects of
			the design system - motion, illustrations, content tone, etc. With more diverse people collaborating, it
			will be exciting to see what the team comes up with.</p>

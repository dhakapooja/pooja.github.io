		<h1>Redesigning Custom Dimensions at Clarisights</h1>
		<p>Clarisights provides realtime, interactive and contextual reporting for high-performance marketing teams. In less than two years from inception, Clarisights is replacing excel sheets and other BI tools for large scale marketing teams around the world.</p>
		<p>I worked with Clarisights team as a UX Design Consultant from Feb 2019 till Jan 2020. I was involved in the redesign process of Custom Dimensions, Knit UI, Widget Creation, Integrations, Date-picker, Sharing report and Filters.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Setting up the design process</h2>
		<p>There was no defined Design process in the company (team); to be fair, there was no design personnel in the team. So, it was expected.</p>
		<p>But Yash Arora (a front end developer) had recently transitioned into the design team. He was a part of the team for more than 12 months before I came in. He was aware of how the product dev cycle ran, how the priorities were set and who pulled the levers to make sure feature requests were shipped.</p>
		<p>Yash and I tried to follow this process in our design cycle.</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.so/suwardhan/Design-Cycle-10-weeks-ac1f8f3c628d4ff0af81b702616421d6">Design Process</a> ↗</p>
		<br>
		<p>In this post, I will be focussing on the Custom Dimension redesign.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>Custom Dimensions</h2>
		<p>A bit of context first. Every Clarisights report is made up of dimensions and metrics.</p>
		<p><b>Dimensions:</b> Dimensions are attributes of your data. The dimension <code>Country</code> indicates the country, for example, "Germany" or "Norway", where a sale happens.</p>
		<p><b>Metrics:</b> Metrics are anything you can count. The metric <code>Items Sold</code> is the total number of items sold in that country. The metric <code>Revenue</code> is the revenue generated on the sale of those items.</p>
		<p>Generally, a data table will have dimension values arranged in rows and metrics in columns. For example, this table shows one dimension (Country) and two metrics (Items sold and Revenue).</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-compact" src="images/clarisights/table.svg">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p><b>Custom Dimensions</b> are like default dimensions, except you create them yourself. Custom Dimension allows you to group your Accounts, Campaigns, or any elements of advertising channels that share a common property. e.g. <code>Product category</code> <code>Location</code> <code>Brand</code></p>
		<br>
		<h2>Gathering Inputs</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Customer Inputs:</h3>
		<p>The Customer Success team at Clarisights is in touch with the customers on a daily basis via Zoom video calls. The team has made their calendars public so that anyone from the team can join the meetings with customers.</p>
		<p>These meetings are a source of the long list of customer inputs, reviews, frustrations; giving us an insight into their behaviour about platform usage and allows us to explore ideas with them about how Clarisights can improve their daily workflow.</p>
		<p>We used to record each input, tag them and analyse them to narrow down and prioritise items to pick up.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Development  Team Inputs:</h3>
		<p>Given the scale of the platform, and the complexities that come along with it; we involved the development team in the design cycle from the start. It helps us in understanding the approach dev team had while building the product, and take that into account while designing.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>The previous design</h2>
		<br>
	</div>


	<img class="img-center" src="images/clarisights/cd-old.png">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Dummy data</p>
		<p>The above interface was designed in the early days of the company. The ad channel count was relatively low, and the interface served well then. But as time progressed, some issues started to arise, which we try to address in the redesign.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>The redesign: a new look</h2>
		<p>We designed a table layout, with each cell being interactive (select, cut, copy, paste), allowing for bulk actions. Also, UI elements were updated in parallel, as the team was working on Knit UI - a new UI library.</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-center" src="images/clarisights/cd-expand.svg">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Dummy data added</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Update to Information Architecture</h3>
		<p>A custom dimension is a grouping of filters for one or multiple ad channels. But in the previous design, ad channels having the same filters were not clubbed, due to which the user had to write the same set of filters multiple times for different ad channels.</p>
		<p>e.g. Dimension Value <code>Brand</code> had the same filter <code>Account contains Brand</code> repeated for Facebook, Twitter and Google Ads.</p>
		<p>To overcome this, we updated the information architecture.</p>
		<p><strong>Before:</strong> Custom Dimension → Ad Channel(s) → Value(s) → Filter(s)</p>
		<p><strong>After:</strong> Custom Dimension → Value(s) → Rule(s)</p>
		<p>Rule = Ad Channel(s) + Filters</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-center" src="images/clarisights/rule.svg">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p>In the new structure, <code>Values</code> are the primary citizens of any custom dimension. A value can have multiple rules, which comprises of multiple ad channels. The user now had to write the repeating filter across multiple channels just once.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Introducing Dependencies</h3>
		<p>In some cases, a custom dimension is used as a part of filters for another  custom dimension. This creates a link between the two. On the modification of one, the other one is indirectly affected. The user has no idea about this until one custom dimension gives out weird outputs.</p>
		<p>There was no way for the user to be alerted before she made any modification in such interlinked custom dimensions.</p>
		<p>To solve this, we introduced <strong>Dependencies</strong>. Dependencies displayed the correlation between different custom dimensions. The user could now see the inter-linking between custom dimensions up to filter level.</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-center" src="images/clarisights/dependencies.svg">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Dummy data</p>
		<p>Dependencies even allowed the user to cross-check, before publishing, on how the changes made to one Custom Dimension may/may not affect any other Custom Dimension.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>New Publish flow</h3>
		<p>Updating a custom dimension is a resource-intensive job - in terms of both time and money. In some cases, it takes 24–48 hours for a single update to be reflected across the platform. Also, the respective custom dimension is locked for edits till the update process is complete.</p>
		<p>But the interface does not do a good job to convey the gravity of the operation. Publishing any edit was just a click away, across each filter. On saving an edit to any filter, it automatically started the publish flow. The interface gave easy access to a rather complex operation.</p>		
	</div>

	<img class="img-compact" src="images/clarisights/publish.svg">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Dummy data</p>
		<p>To reduce this ease of access and give importance to the task, we created a universal Publish flow. User can now make multiple edits to a custom dimension, but won't be pushed to publish instantly.</p>
		<p>The user now has to explicitly perform the publish action using the Publish button on the top. This gave the user one final glance before publishing the edits across the platform.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Publish-notes and activity</h3>
		<p>Custom dimensions are updated on a regular basis. e.g. If a new ad channel is operational, filters need to be updated for certain custom dimensions.</p>
		<p>It's a good practice to make a note about the changes every time a modification is made. This helps any future moderator to understand why a particular change was made and when. There was no such way to preserve context in the older design.</p>
		<p>For this reason, we made a small but important addition to the Publish flow. The users can now add a note/comment across each edit before publishing the changes to the custom dimension (shown in the above image). This will not only help in context-preservation but also allow the user to see an activity timeline for each custom dimension later in future.</p>
	</div>

	<img class="img-compact" src="images/clarisights/activity.svg">

	<div class="div-container">
		<p class="image-caption">Dummy data</p>
		<h3>Drafts</h3>
		<p>Creating or editing a custom dimension can easily become a time-consuming task, involving multiple stakeholders. There are times when the task of creating/editing is not completed in one sitting. There was no way for a user to save the progress and pick up from where she left in the previous interface.</p>
		<p>Hence the concept of Drafts came into being. Any unpublished edits are saved as drafts, allowing the user to come back and continue working on those edits. This also made it possible to verify the edits from other stakeholders involved before pushing the changes across the platform.</p>
	</div>

	<br>
	<div class="div-container">
		<h2>Other Minor Updates:</h2>
		<p><b>Automatic levels assignment:</b> Earlier, while adding a filter to a particular ad channel, the user had to choose at what level the filter needed to be applied. But in the updated version, the system automatically detects the level based on the filters applied. Although this was not a design decision, but an implementation upgrade, it did change the end-user experience significantly. Hence the mention here.</p>
		<p><b>Improved Copy:</b> Clear messaging, guided descriptions and errors to ensure the user is not lost at any step.</p>
		<p><b>Colour-coded rules (filters):</b> Filters can get long and hard to read very easily. Color-coding <code>and/or</code> conditions improved readability of those long filters.</p>
		<p><b>Filter dropdown UI update:</b> Filter dropdown was redesigned from scratch. But since it was treated as a separate component, I will write about it in detail in a separate post.</p>

		<h2>The Rollout</h2>
		<p>Being a significant development effort, the team is carrying out an incremental rollout with few essential features at a time. Initial feedback from the customers seems promising.</p>
		<p>The team is keeping a tab on each feedback and is in the process of polishing the rough edges and in parallel release remaining features.</p>
